# Roller
Roller, an simple lightweight recreation of the Wastelands server roll command

# How and what does it do?!
Roller adds the command /roll(Remade from the wastelands.cc server(RIP))\
When executing roll there is a small chance that your number will go above 10\
When its above 10 the number will be between 100 and 10000\
Then it will drop the item you are holding in your main hand on the ground times the number you rolled divided by 100

# Using Roller in another plugin?
All you need to do is add the jar file to your project\
To run the roll function to API.roll(itemToRoll, Player)
